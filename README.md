## 📖 Overview

**AB Control Hub** is a powerful, secure, and open-source web application designed to diagnose, test, and calibrate Sony PlayStation controllers (**DualShock 4**, **DualSense**, and **DualSense Edge**).

Built with modern web technologies and the **WebHID API**, it runs entirely in your browser. It allows users to fix analog stick drift, finetune controller settings, and test hardware components without installing any third-party software or drivers.

> **Developed with ❤️ by Ahmed Badawy.**
